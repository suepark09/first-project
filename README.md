## Status

Although we completed the front-facing part of the site, the main purpose of this project was to learn more about the git workflow, while learning how to work as a team. Hence some of the features on the site may not be fully functional, and will most likely not be updated in the future.

## What We Learned

- Creating and switching between different branches
- Submitting and merging pull requests
- Resolve merge conflicts
